this is a simplest threadpool which is implemented by c.it provides 3 interfaces as follows:
    1.threadpool_t * threadpool_init(int num);
        num: the number of threads in the threadpool
        return: if succeeded,return a pointer to threadpool;if failed,return NULL
    2.int threadpool_add_task(threadpool_t *pThreadPool,void* (*func)(void *),void *args);
        pThreadPool: a pointer to threadpool which you want to add tasks to.
        func: the function you want to execute.
        args: the arguments of func.
        return: success:0;           error:-1.
    3.void threadpool_destroy(threadpool_t *pThreadPool);
        pThreadPool: a pointer to threadpool which you want to destroy.

there is a test file in this folder,you can test this project like this:
gcc yyThreadPool.c test.c -o testThreadPool -lpthread
./testThreadPool

other thing need to note,you can use compile option "-D LIMITTASK" to limit the number of tasks.
when you use option,it means that another task can't be added to the task queue until there is an 
idle thread.
